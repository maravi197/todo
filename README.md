live hosted on https://mehfilism.github.io/todo/
## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a web-based To-Do List application that supports account logins. Users can manage their daily tasks efficiently while optionally maintaining a personal profile.

The system is designed with a structured separation of concerns:

* Frontend for user interface
* Backend for logic and API handling
* Database for persistent storage

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Create an intuitive and responsive user interface
* Enable task management (add, delete, update tasks)
* Support guest users without account creation
* Provide account-based functionality with user profiles
* Store and retrieve data securely from a server-side database

---

## ⚙️ Features

### 👤 Guest Mode

* No login required
* Tasks stored temporarily (browser storage)
* Quick access for short-term usage

### 🔐 Account Mode

* User registration and login
* Profile details:
  * Name
  * Other information
* Persistent task storage in database

### 📋 To-Do Management

* Add tasks
* Delete tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* View all tasks
